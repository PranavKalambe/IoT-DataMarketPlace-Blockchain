# IoT Data Market Place - Using Private Blockchain





## Overview

This project aims to address the challenges associated with data transactions between data collectors and third-party buyers by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. As IoT devices generate an enormous amount of data, companies that require data often purchase it from companies that generate it. However, third-party buyers of data often face challenges in trusting the authenticity of the data they purchase. Additionally, the risk of data security breaches during data transmission poses a serious threat to data integrity and confidentiality. To overcome these challenges, we have created a decentralized application (DApp) that utilizes smart contracts and distributed ledger technology to facilitate the secure buying and selling of data. Our blockchain-based DApp offers enhanced data security, transparency, trust, privacy, and authenticity, while also empowering users to maintain control over their own data. Through this project, we aim to enable seamless and secure data transactions.


## Problem Statement

To build a system for ensuring authentic and secure transaction of data from vendors to buyer, that eliminates the requirement for third-party brokers and resolves issues related to data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. The objective is to create a tamper-proof and transparent data transfer process while ensuring the privacy of the shared data. By leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology to develop an efficient and dependable system for secure data transfer.


## System Architecture & Working

The architecture for our system consists of two levels of blockchain network.
- Level one is a local blockchain that is implemented individually for each data generator or manager. Each manager has their own local blockchain network, which includes all the sensor nodes owned and managed by that particular manager, along with its local identity. The local blockchain network is responsible for collecting IoT data generated by the sensor nodes and transferring it securely from the sensor nodes to the manager. The local blockchain network also ensures data privacy and confidentiality, and is secured through encryption and validation mechanisms.

- Level two is a global blockchain network that connects all the local blockchain networks created by the data generators or managers. This global blockchain network consists of all the managers and entities who want to buy the data (bidders), and it includes the global identity of managers. The main aim of the global network is to facilitate the buying and selling of data. Managers who have collected data via their sensor nodes through the local blockchain network can put their data up for sale on the global network, and bidders can bid on this data to purchase it. The global blockchain network ensures data authenticity and transparency, and enables secure data transactions through the use of smart contracts and distributed ledger technology.

1. Data Generation: The sensor nodes owned by the data manager generate IoT data.
2. Local Blockchain: The data generated by the sensor nodes is sent to the local blockchain network, which is implemented individually for each data manager. The local blockchain network is responsible for securely transferring the data from the sensor nodes to the manager.
3. Data Management: The local instance of managerâ€”which is a part of the local network, fetches the data from the local blockchain network. The manager further analyzes the data and decides which data to put up for sale on the global blockchain network.
4. Global Blockchain: The selected data is uploaded to the global blockchain network, by the global instance of manager. The global network allows different entities, such as bidders or buyers, to bid on the data put up for sale.
5. Bidding Process: Bidders can place their bids on the data, and the highest bidder will ultimately be able to purchase the data. The global blockchain network ensures that the bidding process is secure and transparent by using smart contracts and distributed ledger technology.
6. Transfer of Ownership: Once the bidding process is closed, the ownership of the data will be transferred to the highest bidder, who will be able to access and use the data.
7. Payment Settlement: The global instance of manager, who put the data up for sale, will receive the amount of the highest bid in their wallet. The amount will be in the form of Ether-- which is the cryptocurrency used on the Ethereum blockchain. The other bidders who placed lower bids will have their money refunded to their wallets.
